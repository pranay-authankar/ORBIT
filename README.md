# ORBIT - School Digital Ecosystem 🌍

> **Live Demo:** [https://pranay-authankar.github.io/ORBIT/](https://pranay-authankar.github.io/ORBIT/)

**ORBIT** is a comprehensive, next-generation digital ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between Students, Teachers, and Parents. It replaces fragmented tools (like WhatsApp, scattered emails, and paper notices) with a single, secure, and professional platform.

## 🚀 Built with Google Technologies

This project powers its core capabilities using a suite of advanced Google tools:

### 1. **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (AI Integration)** ✨
The heart of our intelligent features. We utilize the `gemini-1.5-flash` model to provide:
*   **AI Doubt Solver**: A 24/7 personal tutor for students that answers academic questions instantly and safely.
*   **Content Moderation**: Automated safety checks on social media posts to ensure a bullying-free environment.
*   **Teacher Tools**: AI-assisted exam paper generation and performance summaries.

### 2. **Firebase (Backend & Security)** 🔥
*   **Authentication**: Secure, role-based login (Student, Teacher, Parent) ensuring data privacy.
*   **Firestore Database** (In Progress): Real-time data syncing for chat, announcements, and academic records.
*   **Security Rules**: granular access control preventing unauthorized access to sensitive student data.

### 3. **Google AI Studio** 🧪
Used for prompt engineering and testing the Gemini models to ensure the AI behaves strictly as an educational assistant and safety moderator.

### 4. **Built with Antigravity** 🤖
This entire application was architected and built using **Antigravity**, Google's advanced agentic coding assistant. Antigravity handled:
*   **Full Stack Development**: Writing complex React/TypeScript code and Tailwind CSS styling.
*   **Project Management**: Planning tasks, verifying builds, and managing git history.
*   **Deployment**: Automating the deployment process to GitHub Pages.
